Description:
    Run this generator any moment when you want to create a private graphiql api
    BUT, you need to first create your user_model with `rails g devmaker_rails_sdk:user_model YOURMODELNAME`
    After this you can sign in and click on GO TO GRAPHIQL and run the query me

Example:
    rails generate devmaker_rails_sdk:private_graphql YOURUSERMODELNAME

    This will create:
      * new private schema
      * new graphql controller with autentication
      * new mutation_type and query_type, with query me
      * route to private api
