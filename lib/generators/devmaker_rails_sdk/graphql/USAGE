Description:
    Run this generator once when you want to setup your graphql api
    After this you can start your server `rails server`
    and see your public graphiql on `http://localhost:3000/graphiql`

Example:
    rails generate devmaker_rails_sdk:graphql

    This will create:
      * graphql setup
      * public schema to graphql
      * create a route to public schema
      * generate a mutation_type and query_type on graphql/types/public
      * custom redirect page on user login
